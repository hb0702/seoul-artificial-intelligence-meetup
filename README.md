## Upcoming Meetup
### When
Sunday, June 25, 10AM

### Where
서울특별시 강남구 역삼동 789-4, 서울 ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8%ED%8A%B9%EB%B3%84%EC%8B%9C+%EA%B0%95%EB%82%A8%EA%B5%AC+%EC%97%AD%EC%82%BC%EB%8F%99+789-4,+%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8/@37.4972562,127.0363414,16z/data=!3m1!4b1))

### Program
10:00 - 10:10 Waiting for late-comers

10:10 - 10:40 Introduction to Quantum Computing (Adel, presentation)

10:40 - 11:20 Probability basics (Cinyoung, hands-on tutorial)

11:20 - 12:00 Artificial Neural Networks (Martin)

As we had "homework" for the last meetup, for this one try to implement forward and backward pass of Feed-forward Neural Networks (only fully connected layers). Backward pass should employ stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation algorithm. It is highly recommended to look at explanation and implementation in online book Neural Networks and Deep Learning (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). The first one or two chapters should be enough. During the last part of meetup we will go through theory and implementation details.

### Price
KRW 5,000
